                  <div>

                      <p>Thank you for choosing to be part of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling of 2021 ("ICAPS 2021", "we", "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at icapsGZ2021@gmail.com.</p>p>

                      <p>When you visit our website you trust us with your personal information. In this privacy notice, we describe our privacy policy. We seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have in relation to it. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our sites and conference registration service.</p>p>

                      <p>This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our websites, including our registration website, and/or any related services, or events (we refer to these collectively in this privacy policy as "site" or "sites"). Please read this privacy policy carefully.</p>


<p>What information do we collect?</p>

                      <p>Information you disclose to us In short: We collect personal information that you provide to us such as your name, address, contact information, dietary preferences, data security, and payment information.</p>

<p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering for ICAPS 2021 and at our sites. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us, and the choices you make and the features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:
Name and contact data. We collect your name, email address, postal address, phone number, emergency contact information, origin institution, and other similar contact data.
Payment data. We collect data necessary to process your payment when you register for ICAPS 2021 or choose to stay accommodations administered by ICAPS 2021. Payment data may be stored by our payment processor and you should review their privacy policies and contact the payment processor directly for questions regarding that information. We do not have control over this data. You may contact us using the above email address for our payment processor.
    All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate. You must notify us of any changes to such personal information that may affect your registration or ability to attend ICAPS 2021 or stay in accommodations.</p>

                      <p>Information automatically collected In short: Information such as your IP address, browser, and device characteristics is automatically collected when you visit our site.</p>

                      <p>We automatically collect information when you visit, use or navigate the site. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name) but may include device and usage information, such as referring URLs, device name, country, location, or information about how and when you use your site and other technical information. This information is primarily needed for security and maintenance purposes.</p>

                      <p>Like many conferences with registration fees or accommodation management, we may also collect information through cookies and similar technologies during registration.</p>

                      <p>How do we use your information?</p>
                      <p>In short: We process your information for purposes based on our legitimate interests (e.g., providing conference services), ensuring compliance with the ICAPS Code of Conduct and other policies, ensuring our compliance with legal obligations (including law enforcement), and/or other obligations with your consent.</p>

                      <p>We use personal information collected via our site for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li>To send information to you. We may use your personal information to send you important messages regarding ICAPS 2021.</li>
                          <li>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>
                          <li>For other conference purposes. We may use your information for other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying trends in conference attendance, determining the effectiveness of various conference events, evaluating our site, evaluating third-party servicers, or enforcing conference policies (such as the ICAPS Code of Conduct).</li></ul>
                      <p>Will your information be shared with anyone?</p>
                      <p>In short: We will share minimal data with third-parties (such as caterers, or hotels) to provide conference services and fulfill our obligations with you.</p>

                      <p>We may process or share personal information (but not payment information) based on the following:</p>
                      <ul>
Requests from caterers or other third-party food services that require your name, emergency contact information, preferences, and/or other information.
Requests from third-parties that provide accommodations for the conference that require your name, address, emergency contact information, preferences, and/or other information.
Any performance of a contract we entered into with you that allows us to share information.
Requests from law enforcement that we must respond to as required by law, judicial proceedings, court order (e.g., a subpoena), and/or regional governments.
Emails of an administrative or informative nature to ICAPS attendees, speakers, or other participants using third-party email services. This may require we share certain data with them regarding your name, email address, institution, and/or other personal information.
Requests from payment processors may require that we send your address or other personal information to them to validate or verify your payment.
We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any violation of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to the safety of any person, the prevention of illegal activities, and/or as evidence during litigation in which ICAPS 2021 is involved.
We may publish or display aggregate data when we find it useful (e.g., when collaborating with other conferences, or at an ICAPS council or community meeting). In those cases, we will not share your personal data directly, but it may be possible to identify certain information (e.g., an individualâ€™s stated gender or dietary preference) about an individual when combined with other data (e.g., personal knowledge).
</ul>

<p>Unless we indicate this to you in this policy or via other direct communication, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade your information to third parties for their own promotional purposes. We will do our best to avoid sharing data unnecessarily and will work to only share what is necessary to fulfill our obligations to you.</p>

                      <p>Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</p>
                      <p>In short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information, particularly during payment processes.</p>

                      <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store session information.</p>

                      <p>How long do we keep your information?</p>
                      <p>In short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>

                      <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary to service the ICAPS 2021 attendees and allow us to process data for future ICAPS conferences unless a longer retention policy is required by law (such as for tax purposes, accounting, requirements from funding agencies, or other legal requirements). When we have an ongoing legitimate need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                      <p>How do we keep your information safe?</p>
<p>In short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate organizational security measures designed to protect the personal information we process. However, please remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and from our sites is at your own risk. You should only access our services within a secure environment.
</p>

                      <p>Do we collect information from minors?</p>
                      <p>In short: We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18 years of age.</p>

                      <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the site, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependentâ€™s use of the site. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will delete that data from our records.</p>

                      <p>What are your privacy rights?</p>
                      <p>In short: You may request to review, change, or ask us to delete any of your personal data at any time.</p>

                      <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</p>

                      <p>If you would like to review or change the information you provided to us, you may contact us with the information we have provided (icapsGZ2021@gmail.com). If you wish to have us delete your personal information, you may contact us as well. Some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, enforce our terms of use or other policies, or assist with investigations.</p>

                      <p>Controls for do-not-track features</p>
                      <p>Most web browsers and some mobile systems have Do-Not-Track ("DNT") features or settings you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored. No uniform technology exists for DNT. As such, we do not respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism for communicating your choice to not be tracked online.</p>



<p>Will we update our privacy policy?</p>
                      <p>In short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary.</p>

                      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by the "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We may notify you if we make changes we feel you need to know (e.g., material changes). We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to stay informed.</p>

                      <p>How can you contact us about this policy?</p>
                      <p>You may email us at icapsGZ2021@gmail.com.</p>

                      <p>ICAPS 2021 is operated on a volunteer basis by people throughout the world.</p>
