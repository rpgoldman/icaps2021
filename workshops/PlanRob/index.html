                <h3>Topics and Objectives</h3>
                <p>
                  AI Planning & Scheduling (P&S) methods are key to enabling
                  intelligent robots to perform autonomous, flexible, and
                  interactive behaviors. Researchers in the P&S community have
                  continued to develop approaches and produce planners,
                  representations, as well as heuristics that robotics
                  researchers can make use of. However, there remain numerous
                  challenges complicating the uptake, use and successful
                  integration of P&S technology in robotics, many of which have
                  been addressed by robotics researchers with novel solutions.
                  Strong collaboration and synergy between researchers in both
                  communities is vital to the continued growth of the fields in
                  a way that provide mutual benefits to the two communities. To
                  foster this, the PlanRob workshop aims to provide a stable,
                  long-term forum (having been held annually at ICAPS since
                  2013) where researchers from both the P&S and Robotics
                  communities can openly discuss relevant issues, research and
                  development progress, future directions and open challenges
                  related to P&S when applied to Robotics. In addition to the
                  usual paper submissions, the workshopâ€™s format naturally lends
                  itself to preliminary results, position papers as well as to
                  work focused on challenges in using and integrating planners
                  in robotics systems.

                <h3 class="mt-4">Submissions</h3>

                <p>
                  There are two types of submissions: short position papers and
                  regular papers. Position papers are a maximum of four pages
                  long while regular papers may be up to ten pages long. Papers
                  may have an additional page containing references. Regular
                  papers may be scheduled with more time in the final program. A
                  poster session may be considered to provide a further
                  presentation opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The guidelines for formatting are the same as is used for
                  ICAPS 2021 papers (typeset in the AAAI style as described at:
                  <a href="http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php"
                    >http://www.aaai.org/Publications/Author/author.php</a
                  >), but with the AAAI copyright removed. The papers must be
                  submitted in PDF format via the EasyChair system (<a
                    href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=planrob2021"
                    >https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=planrob2021</a
                  >).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Please note that papers under review (e.g. which have been
                  submitted to IJCAI-2021) are also welcome, however, in order
                  to avoid potential conflicts, these manuscripts should be
                  prepared as anonymous submissions for a double blind reviewing
                  process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Accepted papers will be published on the workshopâ€™s website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The organizers are investigating the availability of journal
                  editors in order to invite a selection of accepted papers from
                  the workshop to a special issue or post-proceedings volume.
