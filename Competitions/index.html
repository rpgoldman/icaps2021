In this competition, participants are invited to develop automatic reinforcement learning solutions to the dynamic job shop scheduling problem (DJSSP). The solutions are expected to automatically train promising agents on a distribution of DJSSP tasks. After a feedback phase where solutions can be developed and fine-tuned with daily feedback, those that perform best on a set of five unseen tasks win the competition.

On the way towards a sustainable future and following up the success of 
<a href="https://l2rpn.chalearn.org/" target="_blank">L2RPN 2020 NeurIPS competition</a>, 
this competition aims at unleashing the power of artificial intelligence even further for our real-world industrial application: controlling electricity power transmission in real-time and moving closer to truly “smart” grids using underutilized flexibilities. In 2020, participants were asked to develop an agent to be robust to unexpected events and keep delivering reliable electricity everywhere even in difficult circumstances. 
<br/>
<br/>
In this competition, participants, while dealing with a higher penetration of renewable energy, will be asked in addition to design trustworthy agents that are able to communicate when they are in trouble, especially when they might fail. This will more concretely lead the path towards an AI assistant for human operators, who will still be responsible for managing the grid, rather than a mere blackbox agent. Join us for this Augmented Intelligence competition!

              <h6><h4 style="display: inline;">Autonomous Driving Prediction Challenge</h4><span class="badge bg-danger m-2">LIVE</span></h6>
              <p class="card-text mt-4 mb-4">

In the field of autonomous driving, it is a consensus in both academia and industry that behavior prediction (e.g., trajectories, actions, intentions) is one of the most challenging problems blocking the realization of full autonomy. The problem cannot be solved without support from real-world motion data containing highly interactive behavior, as well as proper evaluation metrics and approaches for a variety of prediction algorithms based on the data. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Mechanical Systems Control Laboratory (MSC Lab) at UC Berkeley has constructed an INTERnational, Adversarial and Cooperative moTION dataset (INTERACTION dataset) with collaborators from KIT and MINES ParisTech. It accurately recovers large amounts of highly interactive motions of road users (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) in a variety of driving scenarios from different countries. To expedite research and inspire discussions on the evaluation of prediction models/algorithms, we present the INTERACTION-Dataset-based PREdicTion Challenge (INTERPRET). This is a step towards the construction of effective and valuable predictors for the development of autonomous driving.

Huawei manufactures billions of productions in hundreds of factories every year during which a large amount of cargoes need to be delivered among factories. 
Due to the uncertainties of customers' requirements and production processes, most delivery requirements cannot be fully decided beforehand. 
The delivery orders, with the information including the pickup factories, delivery factories, the amount of cargoes and the time requirement, 
occur randomly and a fleet of homogeneous vehicles is periodically scheduled to serve these orders. 
Due to the large amount of deliver requests, even a small improvement of the logistics efficiency can bring significant benefits. 
Participate in this challenge to develop efficient optimization algorithms to dispatch orders and plan the route of vehicles.
